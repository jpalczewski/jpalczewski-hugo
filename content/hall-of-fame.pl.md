List of completed projects that I'm proud of.

# [Animacja](https://github.com/jpalczewski/Animacja)
An core 3.3 OpenGL project for another class - without using any high-level libraries(even without model-loading!) so it was a challenging one. The most helpful material that I found was [LearnOpenGL tutorial](http://www.learnopengl.com/) which helped me a lot.(Shaders are maybe a bit similar, but shh!) I wish I had more time, so I might implement a flashlight or something like that.  


# [Kalman](https://github.com/jpalczewski/Kalman)
Project for [ZPR](https://eres.elka.pw.edu.pl/eres/wwersje$.startup?Z_ID_PRZEDMIOTU=ZPR)(Really enjoyable class!) - completed in one semester. Multi-language(connecting C++ and Python were an unforgettable experience) app which uses an Kalman filter to predict movement from sensors. While working on it, I discovered that Slack + Jenkins + Git can make a game-changer team, making developing multi-platform program and working in team a lot easier.
